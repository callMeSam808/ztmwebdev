Cascading Style Sheets at the most basic level it indicates that the order of CSS rules matter. 


.class
#id
*
element
element, element
element element (looks for 2nd element nested in first element)
element > element (only checks the immediate parent)
element + element (check that 2nd element is after the first element)
:hover
:last-child
:first-child
!important (not recommended)


What seletors win out in the cascade depends on:
-Specificity
-Importance
-Source Order
